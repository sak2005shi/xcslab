      <h4>Q1. Tell me something about yourself.</h4>
      <p>I'm a software engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience in full-stack development using technologies like JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Python. I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and love collaborating in agile environments. During college, I completed several projects and internships that gave me practical exposure to SDLC and teamwork.</p>
      
      <h4>Q2. How did you hear about this position?</h4>
      <p>I found this position through LinkedIn while actively looking for roles that align with my skills and interests in backend development and scalable system design.</p>
      
      <h4>Q3. Why do you want to work with us?</h4>
      <p>Your company stands out for its emphasis on innovation and engineering culture. Iâ€™ve read about your recent projects and contributions to open-source communities, and I see this as an excellent environment to grow while contributing to meaningful products.</p>
      
      <h4>Q4. Why did you choose this career?</h4>
      <p>Iâ€™ve always been drawn to logical problem-solving and creating things. Software engineering gives me the power to build solutions that can impact thousands, if not millions, of users. Itâ€™s the perfect blend of creativity and logic.</p>
      
      <h4>Q5. Where do you see yourself in the next 2/5/10 years?</h4>
      <p>In 2 years, I aim to be a solid contributor on engineering teams, working on core systems. In 5 years, I hope to lead small teams or initiatives. In 10 years, Iâ€™d like to be involved in architectural decision-making or product engineering at a strategic level.</p>
      
      <h4>Q6. What is your greatest strength?</h4>
      <p>Iâ€™m quick to grasp new technologies and frameworks. Iâ€™m also very persistent when debugging or solving complex logic errors, which helps me deliver reliable code.</p>
      
      <h4>Q7. What are your weaknesses?</h4>
      <p>Earlier, I had a tendency to over-engineer solutions. Iâ€™ve been actively working on writing simpler, maintainable code and relying more on peer reviews and mentorship.</p>
      
      <h4>Q8. What do you know about this company/organization?</h4>
      <p>Youâ€™re known for delivering scalable digital solutions and have a strong engineering team. Iâ€™ve seen your product suite and open-source projects, and your culture seems focused on innovation, mentorship, and learning.</p>
      
      <h4>Q9. Why should we hire you?</h4>
      <p>I bring solid technical foundations, a collaborative mindset, and a strong eagerness to learn. I adapt quickly, take ownership of my work, and have a strong ethic of continuous improvement.</p>
      
      <h4>Q10. What has been your greatest professional success/accomplishment so far?</h4>
      <p>In my last internship, I designed a REST API that reduced data retrieval time by 35%. It was later adopted by another team as well. That experience taught me the impact of clean code and scalable design.</p>
      
      <h4>Q11. What are your expectations from us?</h4>
      <p>Iâ€™m looking for mentorship, challenging projects, and opportunities to grow technically and professionally. Iâ€™d appreciate an environment that values learning and innovation.</p>
      
      <h4>Q12. What are your salary expectations?</h4>
      <p>Iâ€™m open to discussing this based on the companyâ€™s compensation structure. My priority is to find a role that provides learning and growth opportunities.</p>
      
      <h4>Q13. Do you have any questions for us?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>What does a typical day look like for a software engineer here?</li>
        <li>How does the team support continuous learning?</li>
        <li>Can you tell me more about the onboarding process?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Behavioural Questions</h4>
      
      <h4>Q14. How do you go about solving a problem?</h4>
      <p>I break it down into smaller parts, analyze the root cause, research possible solutions, and prototype iteratively. I also ask for feedback early to stay aligned.</p>
      
      <h4>Q15. Give an example of a situation in which you saw an opportunity in a potential problem.</h4>
      <p>In college, our project team faced delays due to manual testing. I proposed and implemented basic unit and integration tests, which not only improved quality but sped up development.</p>
      
      <h4>Q16. How do you respond to negative feedback?</h4>
      <p>I see it as an opportunity to improve. I take feedback seriously, reflect on it, and apply it in future tasks. Itâ€™s helped me grow faster.</p>
      
      <h4>Q17. How well do you work in teams?</h4>
      <p>I thrive in team settings. I value communication, respect diverse ideas, and enjoy pair programming or collaborative problem-solving.</p>
      
      <h4>Q18. What is your approach to handling stress?</h4>
      <p>I manage stress by organizing tasks, setting priorities, and taking short breaks. If I feel stuck, I talk to teammates or mentors to get unstuck faster.</p>
      
      <h4>Q19. What gives you the highest mental peace and satisfaction?</h4>
      <p>Seeing a project go live and users benefiting from something I built brings me the most satisfaction. I also enjoy writing clean, efficient code.</p>
      
      <h4>Q20. How would you describe yourself as a person?</h4>
      <p>Iâ€™m curious, detail-oriented, and reliable. I enjoy learning new things, and Iâ€™m committed to doing my best in whatever I take up.</p>
